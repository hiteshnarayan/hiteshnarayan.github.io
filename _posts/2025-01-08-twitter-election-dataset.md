We just released the first version of a large-scale dataset capturing political discourse on Twitter/X related to the
**2024 U.S. Presidential Election**. The dataset consists of over **22 million posts** collected between May 1, 2024 and
July 31, 2024, using a custom-built scraper targeting election-specific hashtags, political figures, and major events.

### Abstract

In this paper, we introduce a dataset comprising 22 million publicly available posts on X.com (formerly Twitter),
collected from May to July 2024. Using a targeted scraping strategy focused on keywords tied to key political figures,
events, and narratives, we aligned our data collection with the U.S. election cycle to study real-time discourse,
sentiment, and misinformation.  
We also present a preliminary analysis of dominant hashtags and topics, laying the groundwork for future research on
online political influence.
