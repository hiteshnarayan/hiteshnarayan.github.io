### Abstract

We present a large-scale dataset of **46 million publicly available posts** on X (formerly Twitter), collected from May
to November 2024 using a custom scraper targeting political discourse related to the U.S. Presidential Election.  
This resource supports the study of:

- Public sentiment
- Misinformation spread
- Discourse themes and election-related narratives  
  We also include an exploratory analysis of dominant hashtags and emerging conversation trends.
