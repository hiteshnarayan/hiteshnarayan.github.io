Hi there!  
I’m a Computer Science graduate student at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/),
focusing on machine learning and data systems.
I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering
from [Visvesvaraya Technological University](https://www.vtu.ac.in/).

Currently, I’m an Informatics Intern at USC's [Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute](https://atri.usc.edu/),
where I help build secure and scalable tools for clinical trials.
I work in an agile, regulated research environment, contributing to full-stack development and test automation.

In 2024,
I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [HUMANS Lab](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/code/)
under [Prof. Emilio Ferrara](https://www.emilio.ferrara.name/),
where I co-authored a paper accepted to CySoc 2025.
My work focused on large-scale social media data collection and the analysis of political discourse during the 2024 U.S.
Presidential Election.

Previously, I worked at [Genpact](https://www.genpact.com/) as a Business Analyst, focusing on business intelligence. I
streamlined enterprise reporting workflows across multiple business units and contributed to automation initiatives for
operations at scale.

## Personal Interests

Outside class, I enjoy mentoring peers, contributing to open-source projects, and serve as an Outreach Board Member
at [G.R.I.D.S](https://gridsusc.com/) USC to help grow the data science community. I also love exploring new places and cultures, and I'm an avid fan of science fiction movies and TV shows.
In my downtime, you’ll often find me trekking or heading out on a spontaneous hike
